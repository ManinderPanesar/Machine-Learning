In week 2, the concept of linear regression was covered extensively. \n
The analytical approach behind linear regression computation was described along with explantion of 
how linear regression model can be extended to multiple input features. \n
Programming using Octave and MATLAB was also introduced with some familiarity in general syntax rules.
The course structure involves hands-on-experience with Machine Learning models.
These models run efficiently on Octave or MATLAB in comparison to other programming or scripting languages. \n
This repository contains the learning outcomes documents and the programming assignment done to complete the module.
