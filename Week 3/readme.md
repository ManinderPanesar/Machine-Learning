In week 3, the topic of logistic regression is covered.
Logistic Regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes.For example, Logistic regression might be used to classify email as a spam or not spam. 

In this module, classification, the cost function for logistic regression and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification are described in detail.

The concept of regularization has also been covered. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. Regularization helps in preventing models from overfitting the training data.
